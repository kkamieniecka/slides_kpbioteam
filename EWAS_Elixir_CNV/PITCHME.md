### EWAS tool development

@size[0.5em](The aim of our project was to develop a population-wide DNA methylation pipeline that is easy to apply and compatible with routine clinical and biological use.)

#### Epigenome-wide Association Studies

@size[0.5em](Epigenome-wide association studies - EWAS analyse genome-wide activity of epigenetic marks in cohorts of different individuals to find associations between epigenetic variation and phenotype. With its high accuracy and low input DNA requirements, the llumina 450k Methylation Assay has became one of the most comprehensive EWAS study solutions. Unfortunately, analysis of the existing 450k data requires considerable programming knowledge and experience as well as high-performance computational hardware.)

### Galaxy server in Centre for Skin Sciences
@size[0.5em]( - More than 200 bioinformatics tools integrated allowing transcriptomics, epigenetics analysis and large scale data visualization)
@size[0.5em](- Available to CSS researchers as a web-based platform.)
@size[0.5em](- Biomedical researchers without programming experience can easily apply tools and workflows to perform transcriptomics, genomics, epigenetics analysis)

---

### Research Software Development
@size[0.5em](- Determining  genetic and non-genetic factors in disease aetiology is one of the principal challenges in clinical and biomedical research.)
@size[0.5em](- Our recently developed suite provides a group of integrated tools that combine analytical methods to analysis epigenetics data into a range of handy easy to use pipelines.)

### Training in Epigenetics

@size[0.5em](We have also provided training sessions and interactive tours for user self-learning. The training materials are freely accessible at the Galaxy project Github repository. Such training and tours guide users through an entire analysis.)

### EWAS - Applications

@size[0.5em](With the rapidly increasing volume of epigenetics data available, computer-based analysis of heritable changes in gene expression becomes more and more feasible. Many genome-wide epigenetics studies have focused on generation of the data, however data interpretation is a challenge now. Risk evaluation, disease management and novel therapeutic development are prompting researchers to find novel bioinformatic frameworks and approaches.  In this regard we propose a user friendly tool suite available via Galaxy platform 'EWAS-Galaxy'. This tools suite allows life scientist to run complex epigenetics analyse.)

### Epigenetics Data Analysis

@ul
The analysis combines 6 main steps:
- 1 Raw intensity data loading .idat files
- 2 Preprocessing and optional normalization
- 3 Quality assessment and control step
- 4 Single nucleotide polymorphism finding and removal
- 5 Differentially methylated positions and regions finding with respect to a phenotype covariate
- 6 Functional annotation and graphical representation
