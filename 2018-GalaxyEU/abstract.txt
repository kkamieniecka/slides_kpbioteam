Microbiota play an important role in human health and drug efficacy. When clinicians suspect an infection, samples are often cultured to determine the microbial species present, however, not all species are culturable and this method often leads to inconclusive results. In such cases, 16S rRNA sequencing may provide additional insight. To pilot this approach, we have developed a Galaxy analysis pipeline in collaboration with an external diagnostics lab servicing a large number hospitals, clinics and GPs in the western Netherlands area.
